## Bio
Hello my names Vinny, My previous jobs provided me experience in working in fast-paced, high energy environments establishing means to expand my skills in team work, work ethic and allowed for overall growth as an individual. I'm a solution-driven individual with experience in working with cross-functional teams and building project plans in Asana and Microsoft Office. I recently acquired my Google Project Management Career Certificate and currently enrolled in YearUp, I'm excited to learn what it takes to become successful and use the knowlege I've gained in this internship towards excelling in life (no pun intended)

## Journey
My journey at Year Up was nerve wrecking but overall challenging. I've came in not knowing how I'd unravel to be a great student but with the help of my mentors I was able to accomplish tasks at ease. It's a curse and a blessing being remote and not hybrid because I tend to procrastinate often when I'm home rather than being in a school invironment where I'll be actively enagaged majority of the time. But I'm working on time management and learning to break out that habit. Overall I commend my class mates for checking up on me to see what assignments are due-vice versa.
